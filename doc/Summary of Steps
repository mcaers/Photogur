Summary of Steps

Created/modified a method called "create" in the PicturesController
What did I do in there?
	@picture = Picture.new
Set the 3 paraeters/attributes of the @picture
@picture.title = params[:title]
..and the other 2
SAVE!!!
	success = @picture.save
Once the picture is saved successfully, redirected to '/pictures'

We removed load_pictures...
In the index action where I need all the pictures, I load them from the DB (instead of heard coding them)
	@pictures = Pictures.all
This returns a collection (Array) of pictures (not hashes)!

Change index.html
picture[:title]
turned into
picture.title
WHY?
Because picture is not a hash, it's a Picture instance
